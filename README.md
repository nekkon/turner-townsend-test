# Turner & Townsend Frontend Technical Assessment

## Challenges

Challenges that I encountered during development of this app were:

* Although a simple one-page app, needed to think as if it was a large app with many views / components / services etc.
* No designs, so not sure if the look and feel is satisfactory.
* Simple page, so not many things to write a test for.

## Successes 

What I have achieved while developing the app:

* Clean architecture principles, using functional or OOP principles: Folder structure follows Angular Style Guide directory structure and medium best practices articles ( ex. https://medium.com/dev-jam/5-tips-best-practices-to-organize-your-angular-project-e900db08702e)
* Clear and a clean approach to styles: Styling follows BEM naming methodology with SCSS variables / theming.
* Simple markup and use of html5 standards: Lighthouse audits grades the app with 100% on Accessibility and SEO.
* Fixed default tests and added a couple more.
* Modular layouts and routing: Views are lazy loaded and layout is based on bootstrap's flex grid.
